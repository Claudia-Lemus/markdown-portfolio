#### These are attributes that I consider important to have as a professional, and I try to be better at them within my daily work.
I consider that I have a good _adaptability_ when there are changes in the environment or conditions, and also to treat different kinds of people. I think I'm **responsible** and have a good sense of **leadership** when it's required. Other skills I identify in myself are _**determination, teamwork**_ and _**proactivity**_.
